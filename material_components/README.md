# Minimal Angular Materials

This project contains minimal examples for several Angular Material
components. I thought this was necessary because the default examples
for Angular Materials are a bit of a jumbled mess -- it can be
difficult to see what is really necessary.

## Components Demonstrated

  - [ ] `material-dropdown-select`: Implemented as a multi-select that
  dynamically updates a model, and that has a minimal separation between its
  layout and the options (which are just strings in this case.)

## Running the Examples

These examples assume some familiarity with Angular Dart.  To see
how to run the examples, see the [Angular Dart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular)
page and go through the tutorial.

These particular examples were compiled with the following Dart version:

```
Dart VM version: 1.24.1 (Wed Jun 14 07:48:25 2017) on "macos_x64"
```

When running the examples, keep the developer console open to view messages.
(Rather than updating models, to keep things simple, I've just added
print statements.)
